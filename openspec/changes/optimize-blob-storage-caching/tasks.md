# Tasks for Optimize Blob Storage Caching

## Overview
Systematic optimization of blob storage caching to improve performance while maintaining data consistency.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis and Strategy Definition
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Audit current caching implementation across all blob operations
  - Review all `fetch` calls to blob storage
  - Document current cache control headers and parameters
  - Identify inconsistencies and performance bottlenecks

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Define selective caching strategy
  - Categorize blob data by update frequency (static vs dynamic)
  - Define appropriate cache durations for each data type
  - Design cache invalidation triggers for data changes

### Phase 2: Implement Read Operation Caching
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Optimize product listing caching
  - Remove unnecessary cache-busting from `getProductsFromBlob()`
  - Implement appropriate cache headers for product index
  - Add selective cache invalidation triggers

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Optimize individual product fetching
  - Review `getProductFromBlob()` caching strategy
  - Balance performance with data freshness requirements
  - Implement consistent cache control headers

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Optimize category data caching
  - Extend existing category cache implementation
  - Standardize category fetch caching across all endpoints
  - Coordinate with category management system

### Phase 3: Optimize Write Operations
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Improve index update efficiency
  - Remove aggressive cache disabling from `updateProductsIndex()`
  - Implement targeted cache invalidation on updates
  - Eliminate retry logic by improving cache coordination

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Optimize product save operations
  - Review `saveProductToBlob()` cache implications
  - Coordinate cache invalidation between individual products and index
  - Ensure immediate consistency for write operations

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Improve delete operation caching
  - Optimize `deleteProductFromBlob()` cache handling
  - Remove retry logic from `removeFromProductsIndex()`
  - Implement immediate cache invalidation for deletions

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Performance testing
  - Measure response times before and after optimization
  - Validate cache hit rates and blob storage request reduction
  - Test concurrent access scenarios

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Data consistency validation
  - Test create/update/delete operations for immediate consistency
  - Validate cache invalidation timing
  - Ensure no stale data scenarios

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Cross-browser and CDN testing
  - Test caching behavior across different browsers
  - Validate CDN cache effectiveness
  - Ensure proper cache header interpretation

## Dependencies
- Understanding of Vercel Blob storage caching behavior
- Next.js caching mechanisms and headers
- Current category management and AI mapping implementations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 60-80% reduction in blob storage request latency for cached data
- [ ] 70% reduction in unnecessary blob storage API calls
- [ ] Elimination of retry logic for cache consistency
- [ ] Consistent cache control headers across all blob operations
- [ ] Maintained data consistency for all CRUD operations

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement changes incrementally with rollback capability
- Monitor data consistency throughout implementation
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
