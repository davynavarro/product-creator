# Blob Storage Caching Specification

## Overview
This specification defines optimized caching strategies for blob storage operations to improve performance while maintaining data consistency.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### REQ-BSC-001: Selective Caching Strategy
**Description**: Implement data-type-specific caching strategies based on update frequency and consistency requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Static assets (images) cached with long TTL (24 hours)
- Product index cached with medium TTL (5 minutes) 
- Individual products cached with short TTL (30 seconds)
- Category data leverages existing cache implementation

#### Scenario: Product Image Caching
- **Given** a product image is uploaded to blob storage
- **When** the image is requested multiple times within 24 hours
- **Then** subsequent requests should be served from cache without hitting blob storage
- **And** cache headers should indicate appropriate TTL

#### Scenario: Product Index Caching  
- **Given** the product index has not been modified
- **When** multiple requests for the product list are made within 5 minutes
- **Then** the cached index should be returned without cache-busting parameters
- **And** the response should include proper cache control headers

### REQ-BSC-002: Coordinated Cache Invalidation
**Description**: Implement targeted cache invalidation that triggers only when data actually changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Cache invalidation occurs immediately upon data modification
- No cache invalidation for read-only operations
- Index cache invalidated when products are added/updated/deleted
- Individual product cache invalidated only for that specific product

#### Scenario: Product Creation Cache Invalidation
- **Given** a new product is created and saved to blob storage
- **When** the product index is updated
- **Then** the index cache should be invalidated immediately
- **And** other unrelated caches should remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Product Update Cache Invalidation
- **Given** an existing product is modified
- **When** the product data is saved to blob storage  
- **Then** only that specific product's cache should be invalidated
- **And** the product index cache should be invalidated
- **And** other product caches should remain valid

### REQ-BSC-003: Consistent Cache Control Headers
**Description**: Standardize cache control headers across all blob storage operations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All read operations use consistent cache control headers
- Write operations include immediate cache invalidation headers
- No conflicting cache directives within the same operation
- Headers are appropriate for content type and update frequency

#### Scenario: Standardized Read Headers
- **Given** any blob storage read operation
- **When** the request is made to fetch data
- **Then** the response should include standardized cache control headers
- **And** the headers should match the defined caching strategy for that data type

### REQ-BSC-004: Elimination of Unnecessary Cache Busting
**Description**: Remove random parameters and timestamp cache busting for stable data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No random query parameters (`&r=${Math.random()}`) for stable data
- Timestamp parameters only used for explicit cache invalidation
- Cache busting only applied when data has actually changed
- CDN and browser caching enabled for appropriate content

#### Scenario: Stable Data Access
- **Given** product data that has not been modified in the last 5 minutes
- **When** the data is requested multiple times
- **Then** no cache-busting parameters should be added to the URL
- **And** the request should leverage existing browser and CDN caches

## REMOVED Requirements

### REQ-BSC-R001: Aggressive Cache Busting (REMOVED)
**Description**: The current implementation of adding timestamp and random parameters to every request is removed in favor of selective cache invalidation.

**Rationale**: Excessive cache busting prevents beneficial caching and degrades performance without providing meaningful consistency benefits.

### REQ-BSC-R002: Retry Logic for Cache Consistency (REMOVED)
**Description**: Retry logic in `removeFromProductsIndex()` and similar functions is removed in favor of proper cache coordination.

**Rationale**: Retry logic indicates underlying cache timing issues that should be resolved through proper cache invalidation rather than workarounds.

## ADDED Requirements

### REQ-BSC-A001: Cache Performance Monitoring
**Description**: Add monitoring capabilities to track cache effectiveness and performance improvements.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Log cache hit/miss ratios for different data types
- Monitor response time improvements
- Track blob storage API call reduction
- Alert on cache invalidation failures

#### Scenario: Cache Performance Tracking
- **Given** the optimized caching system is active
- **When** blob storage operations are performed over time
- **Then** cache performance metrics should be collected and logged
- **And** performance improvements should be measurable and reported

### REQ-BSC-A002: Graceful Cache Degradation
**Description**: Implement fallback behavior when caching systems fail or are unavailable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System continues to function when cache is unavailable
- Automatic fallback to direct blob storage access
- Cache system recovery without service interruption
- Error logging for cache system failures

#### Scenario: Cache System Failure
- **Given** the cache invalidation system encounters an error
- **When** a data modification operation occurs
- **Then** the system should fallback to direct blob storage access
- **And** the operation should complete successfully
- **And** the error should be logged for monitoring

## Implementation Notes

### Cache Durations
- **Images**: 24 hours (static content, rarely changes)
- **Product Index**: 5 minutes (moderate update frequency)
- **Individual Products**: 30 seconds (may be updated frequently)
- **Categories**: 5 minutes (existing implementation, stable data)

### Cache Invalidation Triggers
- Product creation → Invalidate index cache
- Product update → Invalidate specific product + index cache  
- Product deletion → Invalidate specific product + index cache
- Category changes → Invalidate category cache

### Performance Targets
- 60-80% reduction in response latency for cached data
- 70% reduction in blob storage API calls for unchanged data
- Elimination of retry logic and timing-based workarounds
