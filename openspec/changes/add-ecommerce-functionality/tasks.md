## Dependencies

### External Services
- **Stripe Account**: Payment processing setup
- **Email Service**: Order notification delivery
- **SSL Certificate**: Secure checkout requirements

### Internal Systems
- **User Authentication**: Account creation and management
- **Database Schema**: Order and cart data storage
- **Blob Storage**: Order history and user data persistence

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can add products to cart with quantity selection
- [ ] Cart persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Checkout process completes successfully with real payments
- [ ] Orders are created and stored with proper tracking
- [ ] Email confirmations sent for all orders
- [ ] User accounts allow order history viewing
- [ ] Admin panel enables order management

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Cart operations complete within 200ms
- [ ] Checkout page loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Payment processing completes within 10 seconds
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for payment processing

### Security Requirements
- [ ] All payment data handled securely via Stripe
- [ ] User authentication properly implemented

- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all checkout pages

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Payment Failures**: Implement comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Cart Data Loss**: Multiple persistence layers (localStorage + server-side)
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Use established libraries and follow security best practices

### Business Risks  
- **High Cart Abandonment**: Optimize checkout flow and add cart recovery
- **Payment Processing Issues**: Thorough testing with Stripe test environment
- **Scalability Concerns**: Design with horizontal scaling in mind
