## Change ID
`add-products-search`

## ADDED Requirements

### Search and Filtering

#### Requirement: Text Search Products
Users shall be able to search products by entering text that matches product names or categories.

#### Scenario: Search by product name
- **Given** multiple products exist in the listing
- **When** the user types a product name in the search input
- **Then** the system filters the display to show only products matching the search term
- **And** the search is case-insensitive and matches partial strings

#### Scenario: Search with no results
- **Given** the user enters a search term
- **When** no products match the search criteria  
- **Then** the system displays a "No products found" message
- **And** provides an option to clear the search

#### Scenario: Real-time search filtering
- **Given** the user is typing in the search input
- **When** the user pauses typing for 300ms
- **Then** the system automatically filters results without requiring a button press

#### Requirement: Category Filter
Users shall be able to filter products by selecting a specific category from a dropdown.

#### Scenario: Filter by category
- **Given** products exist with different categories
- **When** the user selects a category from the filter dropdown
- **Then** the system displays only products in that category
- **And** shows the count of filtered results

#### Scenario: All categories option
- **Given** the category filter is active
- **When** the user selects "All Categories"
- **Then** the system displays all products regardless of category
- **And** removes the category filter

#### Requirement: Sort Products
Users shall be able to sort products by different criteria with ascending/descending options.

#### Scenario: Sort by creation date
- **Given** products are displayed in the listing
- **When** the user selects "Date" from the sort dropdown
- **Then** the system sorts products by creation date (newest first by default)
- **And** provides toggle for ascending/descending order

#### Scenario: Sort by product name
- **Given** products are displayed in the listing
- **When** the user selects "Name" from the sort dropdown
- **Then** the system sorts products alphabetically by name
- **And** provides toggle for A-Z/Z-A order

#### Scenario: Sort by price
- **Given** products are displayed in the listing
- **When** the user selects "Price" from the sort dropdown
- **Then** the system sorts products by price (lowest to highest by default)
- **And** provides toggle for low-to-high/high-to-low order

#### Requirement: Advanced Filtering Options
Users shall be able to apply multiple filter criteria simultaneously for refined product discovery.

#### Scenario: Price range filtering
- **Given** products have different price points
- **When** the user sets minimum and maximum price values
- **Then** the system displays only products within the specified price range
- **And** updates the results count accordingly

#### Scenario: Multiple tag filtering
- **Given** products have various tags assigned
- **When** the user selects multiple tags from a tag filter
- **Then** the system displays products that contain any of the selected tags
- **And** shows selected tags as removable filter chips

#### Scenario: Date range filtering
- **Given** products were created on different dates
- **When** the user selects a date range (last week, last month, custom range)
- **Then** the system displays only products created within that timeframe
- **And** provides preset options for common date ranges

#### Requirement: Combined Search and Filters
Users shall be able to use text search in combination with filters and sorting for precise results.

#### Scenario: Search with active filters
- **Given** the user has active category and price filters
- **When** the user enters text in the search box
- **Then** the system applies the text search only to the already filtered results
- **And** maintains all active filter states

#### Scenario: Filter state indicators
- **Given** multiple filters are applied
- **When** the user views the products listing
- **Then** the system displays active filter indicators showing current selections
- **And** allows individual removal of each filter criterion

#### Requirement: Clear All Filters
Users shall be able to reset all search and filter criteria with a single action.

#### Scenario: Clear filters button
- **Given** search or filter criteria are active
- **When** the user clicks the "Clear Filters" button
- **Then** the system removes all search terms, category filters, and sort criteria
- **And** displays all products in default order

#### Scenario: Clear filters visibility
- **Given** no search or filter criteria are active
- **When** the user views the products listing
- **Then** the "Clear Filters" button is hidden or disabled
- **And** only becomes visible when filters are applied

### Search Interface

#### Requirement: Search Input Component
The system shall provide a dedicated search input field with appropriate visual indicators.

#### Scenario: Search input design
- **Given** the user views the products page
- **When** the search interface loads
- **Then** a search input field is displayed with a search icon
- **And** includes placeholder text "Search products..."
- **And** is accessible via keyboard navigation

#### Requirement: Filter Controls Layout
Search and filter controls shall be organized in a clear, accessible layout above the products grid.

#### Scenario: Filter controls arrangement
- **Given** the user views the products page
- **When** the search interface loads
- **Then** search input, category filter, and sort controls are arranged horizontally
- **And** layout adapts responsively on smaller screens
- **And** includes results count display

### Performance and Usability

#### Requirement: Search Performance Optimization
Client-side search and filtering shall maintain responsive performance for typical product volumes.

#### Scenario: Search response time
- **Given** up to 100 products are loaded
- **When** the user performs search or filtering operations
- **Then** results update within 100ms of user input
- **And** the interface remains responsive during filtering

#### Requirement: Search State Management
Search and filter state shall persist during user interactions that don't navigate away from the page.

#### Scenario: Maintain search state
- **Given** the user has active search criteria
- **When** the user performs bulk operations or other page interactions
- **Then** the search state is preserved
- **And** filtered results remain consistent

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Core Listing Functionality

#### Requirement: Display Product Grid (Modified)
The system shall display products in a responsive grid layout with integrated search and filtering capabilities.

#### Scenario: User views products list with search
- **Given** the user navigates to the products page
- **When** products exist in the system
- **Then** the system displays search controls above the products grid
- **And** the grid shows products filtered by current search criteria
- **And** displays result count and filter status

## Updated Data Interfaces

### SearchState Interface (New)
```typescript
interface SearchState {
  searchTerm: string;
  selectedCategory: string | null;
  priceRange: {
    min: number | null;
    max: number | null;
  };
  selectedTags: string[];
  dateRange: {
    from: Date | null;
    to: Date | null;
    preset?: 'week' | 'month' | 'quarter' | 'year' | 'custom';
  };
  sortBy: 'date' | 'name' | 'price';
  sortDirection: 'asc' | 'desc';
}

interface FilterChip {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  type: 'category' | 'price' | 'tag' | 'date';
  removable: boolean;
}
```

### ProductsListProps Interface (Modified)
```typescript
interface ProductsListProps {
  initialProducts: ProductIndexItem[];
  // New optional props for search configuration
  enableSearch?: boolean;
  defaultSearchState?: Partial<SearchState>;
}
```

## Updated Performance Requirements

- Search filtering operations complete within 100ms for up to 100 products
- Debounced search input reduces API calls and improves responsiveness  
- Memoized filter results prevent unnecessary re-calculations

## Updated Accessibility Requirements

- Search input includes proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Filter controls are keyboard navigable with appropriate focus management
- Screen readers announce result counts and filter status changes
- Clear semantic structure for search interface elements
