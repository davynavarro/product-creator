# Improve Search Interface Text Readability

## Change ID
`improve-search-text-readability`

## Why
The current search and filter interface has text readability issues that impact user experience and accessibility. Users report difficulty reading various text elements including:

- Small text sizes in price range inputs making them hard to read
- Low contrast gray text colors that don't meet accessibility standards
- Filter chips with text that's too small for comfortable reading
- Placeholder text that's barely visible against input backgrounds
- Button text that lacks sufficient contrast in certain states

These readability issues create barriers for users with visual impairments and make the interface less user-friendly overall.

## What Changes
This proposal improves text readability across the search and filter interface:

- **Increase Text Sizes**: Upgrade small text to more readable sizes
- **Improve Color Contrast**: Replace light gray colors with higher contrast alternatives
- **Enhance Button Readability**: Improve text contrast in buttons and interactive elements
- **Optimize Filter Chips**: Make active filter indicators more readable
- **Accessible Placeholder Text**: Ensure placeholder text meets contrast requirements
- **Consistent Typography**: Apply standardized text sizing throughout the interface

## Solution Overview
Implement comprehensive text readability improvements that include:

- **Typography Scale**: Use consistent, accessible text sizes (base 16px minimum)
- **High Contrast Colors**: Replace gray-400/500/600 with darker, more readable alternatives
- **Enhanced Interactive Elements**: Improve button and link text visibility
- **Accessible Color Palette**: Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use text weight and size to create clear information hierarchy
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure text remains readable on smaller screens

## Scope

### In Scope
- Search input text and placeholder styling
- Filter dropdown text and option visibility
- Price range input text sizes and contrast
- Sort control text readability
- Filter chip text and background contrast
- Button text and hover states
- Clear filters button visibility

### Out of Scope
- Product card text (separate from search interface)
- Page headers and navigation text
- Icon styling (focus on text only)
- Complete design system overhaul
- Color scheme changes beyond readability fixes

## Success Criteria
- All text elements meet WCAG AA accessibility standards (4.5:1 contrast ratio)
- Text sizes are at least 16px for body text, 14px minimum for secondary text
- Users can easily read all search interface elements without strain
- Filter chips are clearly readable with appropriate contrast
- Placeholder text is visible but doesn't interfere with entered text
- Interface remains visually cohesive while improving readability

## Technical Approach
- Update Tailwind CSS classes to use higher contrast text colors
- Increase text sizes from `text-sm` to `text-base` where appropriate
- Replace `text-gray-400/500/600` with `text-gray-700/800/900` for better contrast
- Ensure consistent typography scale across all interface elements
- Test with accessibility tools to validate contrast ratios

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies required
- Uses existing Tailwind CSS color and typography utilities
- Maintains compatibility with current component structure

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Visual Consistency Risk**: Text changes may affect overall design harmony
  - *Mitigation*: Apply systematic color and size changes following design principles
- **Mobile Layout Risk**: Larger text might affect mobile layout
  - *Mitigation*: Test responsive design and adjust spacing as needed
- **User Adaptation Risk**: Users accustomed to current interface
  - *Mitigation*: Changes improve standard compliance and should feel natural

## Timeline Estimate
- Implementation: 0.5-1 day
- Testing and validation: 0.5 day
- Accessibility audit: 0.5 day

## Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Significantly improves accessibility and user experience
- **Low Risk**: Only styling changes, no functional modifications
- **High Value**: Better compliance with accessibility standards and improved usability
