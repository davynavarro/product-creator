# Order Calculations Utility Refactoring

## Overview
Successfully created a centralized utility function for calculating order totals, taxes, and shipping fees to ensure consistency across the entire application.

## Files Created

### `/src/lib/order-calculations.ts`
- **Main utility function**: `calculateOrderTotals(items, currency)`
- **Helper functions**: 
  - `calculateTotalCents(items)` - for Stripe payment processing
  - `getShippingFee(subtotal)` - shipping calculation
  - `calculateTax(subtotal, taxRate)` - tax calculation
- **Consistent business rules**:
  - Free shipping over $50, otherwise $9.99
  - 8% tax rate
  - Proper rounding to 2 decimal places

## Files Updated

### API Routes
1. **`/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`** - Updated `preview_order` tool to use utility function
2. **`/src/app/api/direct-checkout/route.ts`** - Replaced inline calculations
3. **`/src/app/api/agent-checkout/route.ts`** - Updated to use utility (with special SPT handling)

### Frontend Components
1. **`/src/components/checkout/OrderReview.tsx`** - Replaced manual calculations
2. **`/src/components/checkout/SavedPaymentMethodForm.tsx`** - Updated to use helper functions
3. **`/src/app/cart/page.tsx`** - OrderSummary component now uses utility function

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Consistency**
- All tax and shipping calculations now use the same business logic
- No discrepancies between chat agent, manual checkout, and cart display

### ✅ **Maintainability** 
- Single source of truth for business rules
- Easy to update tax rates or shipping policies in one place
- Reduced code duplication

### ✅ **Type Safety**
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for cart items and order totals
- Compile-time validation of calculation logic

### ✅ **Testing Ready**
- Isolated utility functions can be easily unit tested
- Pure functions with predictable inputs/outputs

## Business Rules Centralized

1. **Shipping Logic**: Free shipping over $50 subtotal, otherwise $9.99 flat rate
2. **Tax Calculation**: 8% of subtotal amount
3. **Currency**: USD default with configurable currency parameter
4. **Rounding**: All amounts properly rounded to 2 decimal places

## Verification

- ✅ Build compilation successful
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passed
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Consistent calculations across all components

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Basic usage
const orderTotals = calculateOrderTotals(cartItems);
// Returns: { subtotal, shipping, tax, total, currency }

// For Stripe payments
const totalCents = calculateTotalCents(cartItems);

// Individual calculations
const shipping = getShippingFee(subtotal);
const tax = calculateTax(subtotal);
```

This refactoring ensures that whether a user checks out manually, through the AI agent, or views their cart, they will see identical tax and shipping calculations throughout their shopping experience.
